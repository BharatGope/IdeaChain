# IdeaChain
●How it Works
The current prototype of IdeaChain is a straightforward, front-end application with the following workflow.      

  ○Registration: Users can input their idea, which is then assigned a unique SHA-256 hash, and this information is stored locally in the browser   
  
  ○Verification: To verify an idea, a user can re-enter the details, and the system will check if a matching hash already exists ●Export: For record-keeping, the registered ideas can be exported to an Excel file 

●Technology Stack
The prototype was built using the following technologies 

  ○Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
  
  ○Hashing: The Web Crypto API is used to generate a SHA-256 hash �.Storage: Browser LocalStorage is used for temporary data storage 
  ○Exporting: The XLSX.js library is used to simulate an Excel export 
  
●Future Plans
  
  The project is planned to be developed in several phases, moving from the current prototype to a full-fledged open innovation platform. The next steps include connecting to a persistent database like Firebase or MongoDB, and then integrating with a blockchain network such as Ethereum or Polygon 
  ○Future enhancements could include NFT-based ownership certificates, AI-powered plagiarism detection, and a community voting system 
  
●Key ChallengesThe development of IdeaChain has faced some challenges, including understanding blockchain concepts, connecting the front-end to a blockchain network, and managing data synchronization 

●Despite these hurdles, the project aims to empower innovators by providing a trustworthy and accessible platform for protecting their intellectual creations �.
